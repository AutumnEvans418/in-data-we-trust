# Team In Data We Trust: Topic Modeling
Final Project Submission to perform topic modeling on NYT articles dataset.

## Problem
**Topic Modeling:**
Introduction: In the world we live in, data streams are constantly being gathered. This means that mining the gathered data for insights might get extremely laborious and time-consuming. Large amounts of textual data may be arranged, searched for, and understood with the help of topic modeling. In the field of machine learning, a topic model is precisely described as a natural language processing method that uncovers text's latent semantic patterns inside a corpus, or collection of documents. A continuous set of words, such as a paragraph or an article, where each article has a set of words, is generally referred to as a document.

**Task**: Perform the topic modeling on the dataset below and retrieve the most important topics. Also report on the key words associated with each topic.
